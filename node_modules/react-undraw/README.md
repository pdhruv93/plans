# Illustrations

**Bring your own illustrations!** To comply with the updated unDraw [license](https://undraw.co/license), we can't
bundle the illustrations with this package 😞 However, this means you can always use the latest illustrations! 😎

Here's what you need to do:

- Download any illustrations you want from [unDraw](https://undraw.co/illustrations).
  - No need to change the color before download, use `primaryColor` prop instead.
  - Optional: rename file to remove prefix/suffix (`undraw_barbecue_3x93.svg` => `barbecue.svg`).
  - The `name` prop will need to match your file name.
- Put SVG files in an `undraw` folder at the root of your project.
- Add `react-undraw-cli` to your `build` and/or `start` script:
  - `"prebuild": "react-undraw-cli"`
  - or ... `"build": "react-undraw-cli && react-scripts build"`

Example project structure:

```
package.json
src/
 ...
undraw/
  coding.svg
  hologram.svg
  ice_cream.svg
  ...
```

# Development

```
npm install
npm run build
```
